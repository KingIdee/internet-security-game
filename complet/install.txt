LANGUAGES USED IN DEVELOPING THE GAME:
1. User Interface: HTML5, and CSS3
2. Game Egine: Javascript
3. Server: PHP and MYSQL

1. User Interface: the languages used in createing the user interface are HTML and CSS. these where choosen because they where to use and understand, and they are currently the de facto standard in creating user interfaces both for desktop and web applications.

2. Game Engine: The language used in developing the game is Javascript, reason being that it fits well with HTML5/CSS3 paradigm. Knowing fully well that the game will run on the user's browser made javascript a perfect choice for this project.

3. Server: At some point, there was need to store user's high score some where... there are so many ways of doing this:
  browser cookies, sessions, and local storage. but using any these restricts the high scores to only the user's browser thus, i needed a way to store the high scores so that it will be accessible to everyone playing the game on the internet... and hence, the PHP/MYSQL.
 These where choosen because they where easy to set up etc.

 DATABASE TABLES AND FIELDS
  The tables in the database are just two:
  1. USER table: for storing user information
  2. GAME table: for storing game data such as high Scores
